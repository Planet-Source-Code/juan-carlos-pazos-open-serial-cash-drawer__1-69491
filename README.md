### Description

This application has several codes for open a serial cash drawer.

I had a Point of Sale application and need to add this future to it, so after several hours digging and testing several codes, found these.

For me the code behind buttons 3 and 4 works; the app, contains 6 different methods for open a serial cash drawer, hope one of them is right for you.

Tested with Epson receip printer only.
